DSP Template Toolbox v1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the digital signal processing (DSP) template toolbox.
The package is aimed at comprehensive DSP components modelling
and analysis. It provides all the needed instruments to model,
analyse and develop DSP components.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The main concept of the package is "LOW-LEVEL-KERNEL within the HIGH-LEVEL-SHELL".
The chosen concept provides code flexibility and competitive runtime.
The code model does not use .cpp files because most of it's components are template.
The code model is built to be self consistent and have as less dependecies and code files as
possible. Nearly all the models of this package have been tested and are used in real
relay protection microprocessor devices.

Package also contains library to work with COMTRADE oscillograms.
The library compiled for x64 architecture.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The package capabilities
1. Classic IIR filters modelling: Butterworth, Chebyshev I, Chebyshev II, Elliptic
2. Classic windowed FIR modelling
3. Transfer function model using numeric fractional substitution algorithm
4. Complex arithmetics, functions and complex number model
5. Special math functions, FFT algorithms with input resampling and many
other models and functions ( for further details see doxygen html documentation )
